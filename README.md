# DCVaccineSiteMap
The code in this repository creates the [DC COVID-19 vaccination site map](https://a78apps.shinyapps.io/DCVaccineCenterMap/). This interactive map displays the vaccination sites listed on the [DC Government's COVID-19 page](https://coronavirus.dc.gov/vaccinatedc) and pharmacies that carry the vaccine (currently Giant and Safeway). The map provides registration links for each vaccination site and can also be used to locate the site closest to the user. 

Note that the vaccine is currently restricted to DC residents who are 65 years old or older; have a qualifying medical condition (18 and older); or are a member of an eligible workforce. The map will be updated as the vaccine becomes more widely available in the District.
